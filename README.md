# Ordering overview

A demo of how a cat-food subscription service might show customers their next delivery details (featuring my cat, Sushi!).

## Project setup

1. Make sure you have Node ≥ 18 and npm installed.
2. Run `npm run install:all` in the repo root to install dependencies for `/client` and `/server`.
3. Start both servers with `npm run dev` (from the root).

## Thoughts

- First time on NestJS for me; the Angular-style decorators made it feel comfy fast.
- Had fun reshaping the JSON on the server instead of the client - a nice change.
- Spent some time trying to keep the 2 decimal places in the JSON output but lost

## Future improvements

- A proper mobile layout
- Better error handling
- Adding unit tests!! Very important - just didn't fit in with the time constraints
